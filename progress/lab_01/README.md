In this lab, we create a basic program for some basic algorithm in Rasterization Graphics:
1. [DDA line generation algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dda-line-generation-algorithm-computer-graphics/)
2. [Bresenham's line generation aldgorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bresenhams-line-generation-algorithm/)
3. [Mid-point circle drawing algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mid-point-circle-drawing-algorithm/)

We use basic `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` to write the program with simple UI.
